COMPONENTS:
    LCD Display
    Servo
    LED
    Joystick?
    PIR?
    Seven segment display?
    Four digit display?

    Joystick and PIR components would post to the server.
    LCD, servo, and LED compnents would be controlled by the server.

    - Utilize the four digit display to show pressure levels from an api call?
    - Use the four digit display to register DOM events? Like clicks or button presses?
        How would this be useful?
    - Read data entered into the DOM into the LCD screen or 7 segment display
    - Use a photo resistor to trigger dark mode?
        QUESTION: Should I use the ADC value or the resistance value to trigger dark mode?
    - Use the client to control a servo. Servo should send information back to the client.
        Button to start and stop, increase and decrease speed.
    - Send ultrasonic distance information to the client? What purpose would this serve?
    - Display hygrothermograph information on the DOM. Use the temperature or humidity
        to trigger a DOM event?
    - Could I use the joystick to trigger  a DOM event? Maybe to change colors?

This is a project that was created as a final project for IT 101: Internet of Things Programming at South Hills School of Business and Technology in 2023.

The goal was to design and implement a web server that could remotely control hardware components connected to a Raspberry Pi, as well as provide client-side responses to hardware events.

Python was the primary language utilized with Flask as the server framework. Components were connected primarily through web sockets and included an LED, a photoresistor, a hygrothermograph, an accelerometer, an LCD screen, and an infrared sensor.
